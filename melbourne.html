        <h1>Melbourne highlights: what to do and where to eat</h1>
        <p class="text" >A metropolitan city located in the Australian state of Victoria, Melbourne is famous for its iconic skyscrapers and diverse culture. Planning to visit "Down Under"? Look no further! Here’s a highlight of all the exciting activities we did for the past week. From sightseeing to trying all sorts of food, don’t forget to include these spots in your next trip.</p>
        <h4 id="head">Flinders Street</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Home to Australia’s oldest train station, Flinders Street Railway Station is adorned with a green copper dome and brightly yellow walls. Built in 1910, the architecture style stands out from the contrasting sky scrappers making it one of the city’s most iconic landmarks. Still in operation today, 1500 trains depart and arrive from it transporting roughly 110,000 commuters to and from this vibrant city.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Opposite to the station lies a hidden thift store. If you are interested in second hand clothing or shopping for unique vintage pieces, RetroStar Vintage Clothing store would be perfect for you! Located on the first floor of Nicholas building, they house a wide variety of styles and sizes to cater for everybody!</p>

        <h4 id="head">Queen Victoria Market</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>With a controversial past, the land that the present day Queen Victoria market now sits on used to be Melbourne’s first official cemetery back in 1837. It has come far since as it has been in operation for 140 years and home to over 600 small businesses. Nowadays, the market is known for fresh and specialty produce, hand-made items, souvenirs, clothing and flavorful coffee along with food. </p>
            <br>
            <p>On our stroll around the market, we picked up some fresh fruits ranging from apples to strawberries at incredibly affordable prices. Depending on the harvest season, the variety of fruits and their taste could change. The isle next to the fresh produce were hand-made products along with antiques and nicknacks. From CDs to postcards, we even saw a booth selling handmade candles! At the food hall, we were greeted with a variety of fresh seafood and deli meats. With such prices, who could say no to freshly shucked oysters? To end off our market trip on a sweet note, we visited a small candy store by the exit to get some assorted gummies.</p>

        <h4 id="head">Brunch Culture</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Brunch, also known as breakfast and lunch, is a bonding activity among many Australians. Nothing beats avocado toast with a side of bacon and a cool latte to wash it all down. Do it like the locals and grab a few friends, enjoy their company and savour the delectable food! </p>
            <br>
            <p>Our first stop of the day is Operation 25, a brunch cafe located in an early 1900s building. Known for their food and specialty coffee, we tried their Hojicha latte and Pork Benedict which did not disappoint. However, it was relatively crowded for lunch time so we ended up sitting outside. The March winds may be unforgiving but the food warmed us right up.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Industry beans at Fitzroy offered a more modern twist on the traditional brunch. The airy and open interior paired with the friendly staff made the entire dining experience very welcoming. We ordered their signature Porcini Nest which came with porcini dusted egg and a nest made of potatoes to mimic a bird’s nest. To balance out the flavour, it included a side of mushrooms and kale topped with truffle oil. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Lastly, we visited Higher Ground on Little Bourke Street. Previously a power station, it has been redecorated into an industrial-chic hang out spot serving up an all day brunch menu. Here, we tried the avocado pretzel which was garnished with whipped ricotta, seed cracker, poached eggs and lime dressing giving it a tangy yet creamy flavour. Although it is a vegan dish, we decided to order an extra side of bacon to make sure we were energised for the day!</p>

        <h1>Singapore: the garden city's architechture</h1>
        <p class="text" >What is Singapore known for? To some, it might be the food, to others it might be the customs. Culture can be identified through different mediums and one of them is architecture. Singapore boasts a variety of building styles from colonial bungalows to modern skyscrapers. Here are a few of my favourite areas that are home to the different types of structures. </p>
        <h4 id="head">Haji Lane</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>A neighbourhood of Kampong Glam, the stumpy shophouses are an icon of this little street. Nowadays, they are lined with clothing stores, souvenir shops and artisanal cafes to appeal to the younger generation. Aside from eating and shopping, Haji Lane is also known for its brightly coloured murals painted by popular street artists. To escape the hustle and bustle, take a short walk down to Sultan Mosque, being one of the most prominent religious buildings in Singapore it is famous for its golden domes and spacious prayer halls. </p>

        <h4 id="head">Chijmes</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>In the present day, Chijmes is known for its food and beverage, lifestyle and entertainment destination for Singaporeans. Located in the Civic District, the building complex stands out compared to its modern counterparts. Designed by a well known colonial architect, Chijmes has the ability to captivate visitors with its neoclassical design and charm. Boasting green lawns, marble waterfalls and courtyards, it is a great place to unwind after a long day.

        <h4 id="head">Armenian Street </h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Named after the influx of Armenian traders who used to reside there in the 1800s, the street is situated near the Singapore Management University. Armenian Street is home to many museums and trendy eateries. From the newly renovated Peranakan Museum to the Childrenâ€™s Museum of Singapore, there is also a mix of old architecture paired with modern art murals. With so much to sightsee, Armenian Street will not disappoint!</p>

        <h4 id="head">Clarke Quay</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>A historical riverside quay where traders back in the day used to dock, Clarke Quay has come a long way since its former days. With a breathtaking view of the Singapore River lined with vibrant shophouses, take a stroll along the Singapore River to relax your mind. Although Clarke Quay is now known for its ecstatic and dazzling nightlife thanks to the pubs and restaurants, the heritage and history will forever be ingrained in the memories of Singaporeans.</p>

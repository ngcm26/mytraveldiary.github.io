        <h1>Top 3 things to do in Phu Quoc, Vietnam</h1>
        <p class="text" >Located off of the coast of Cambodia is a Vietnamese Island known for its emerald sea and white sands. Either you’re reconnecting with nature or you’re looking for some exciting water activities, Phu Quoc is undeniably the best place to be. If you’re planning to give this tranquil island a visit, do take note of the 3 must see and do!</p>
        <h4 id="head">1. Soak up the sun by the beach</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Mostly known for its endless coastline and white sands, Phu Quoc’s beach is undeniably the best place to wind down and relax. You can either enjoy a fresh coconut by the shore or partake in adrenaline rush activities such as parasailing, there is always an activity for everybody. Surrounded by the clear water and palm trees, it truly is paradise here. There are plenty of beaches scattered across the island such as “Bãi Sao”, “Hòn Thơm” and “Bãi Sao Biển”. However, we only got to visit “Bãi Khem” due to its proximity to the hotel we stayed at.</p>

        <h4 id="head">2. Visit Sunset Town</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Inspired by the colourful “Mediterranean Town", the intricate and lively buildings paint the skies of Phu Quoc. The reason behind the name of this so-called town is due to its strategic location. Being the only Vietnamese island that is located in the South-West, it offers the best view of the sunset. As the sun starts to go down, grab a friend or two and get mesmerised by the purple, orange and red hues of the sky.</p>

        <h4 id="head">3. Indulge in the incredibly fresh seafood</h4>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Located on a tropical shore, Phu Quoc is a thriving fishing island. From oysters to the different kinds of fish, the seafood is not only incredibly fresh but it is also prepared in intricate ways to help bring out the best flavour of each fish. Sink your teeth into Phu Quoc’s delicacy also known as herring fillet salad coated with onion and grated coconut flakes. Commonly eaten with lettuce and rice paper, the sour tamarind sauce adds a slight tanginess to create a delightful taste. </p>
